# Multiclass-LogisticRegression

assumtion is if sigmoid is can be activation for logistic regression, how about softmax ? 
yes this why i try to maked it. softmax have a same effect with sigmoid that is can give outputs as probability of values. 
this project use backpropogation mechanism cause a general teknik for count gradient in softmax + SparseCategoricallCrossEntropy loss
